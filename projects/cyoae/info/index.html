    <p>This is an engine for writing online choose-your-own-adventure stories. Writing them really isn't hard.</p>
    <p>Each page on an adventure can consist of heading(s), image(s), paragraph(s), and choice(s), in any order. You should first plan out your story, and what will be included on a page.</p>
    <p>Each page begins by declaring its internal name after an @ sign. If you want to create a page called "morning", you would write @morning on its own line. In subsequent lines, you can create headers with #, images by url after a *, and paragraphs with >. To include a choice, you have to include the internal page name between two forward slashes, and put choice text afterwards. The example adventure seen on the home page looks like this:</p>
    <div id="input">@wake<br>#You woke up.<br>*https://media0.giphy.com/media/7zMvSDWl3RkDSpOjBC/giphy-downsized-large.gif<br>>Good morning<br>/zzz/Go back to sleep<br>/out of bed/Get out of bed<br><br>@zzz<br>#You went back to bed<br>*https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/bb/bd/2cbbbdff62e5faba5c761d7c48c1957e.gif<br>>zzzzzzzz you're sleeping<br>/wake/zzz...<br><br>@out of bed<br>#You died.<br>/wake/try again</div>
    <p>Once you have this written, run it through a base64 encoder like base64encode.org. This step is just to obfuscate the adventure to readers, so that they aren't spoiled just by putting in your story.</p>
